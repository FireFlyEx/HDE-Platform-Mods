# Install-Over-Mods
The mods here are all projects so large that they are basically standalone. These have been updated to be installed over Freelancer: HD Edition.

# Installing-HDE
Once you have made a fresh install of the original game (any language version), you then need to install HDE.

Step 1: Download the HDE 0.6 release here: https://github.com/BC46/freelancer-hd-edition/releases/download/0.6/FreelancerHDSetup_v0_6.exe
	If you are having issues then visit the HDE wiki: https://github.com/BC46/freelancer-hd-edition/wiki
	You can also visit us on Discord to ask for help or just talk about HDE: https://discord.gg/AFBbHzU4tU

Step 2: Run the FreelancerHDSetup_v0_6.exe file and install HDE.
	If you are using a non-English version of the game then DO NOT check the "Apply English Freelancer improvements" option because it will overwrite your game with English text.
