# Install-Over-Mods
The mods here are all projects so large that they are basically standalone. These have been updated to be installed over Freelancer: HD Edition.

# Installing-HDE
Once you have made a fresh install of the original game (any language version), you then need to install HDE.

**Step 1**: Download the [*Freelancer: HD Edition v0.6 Release*](https://github.com/BC46/freelancer-hd-edition/releases/download/0.6/FreelancerHDSetup_v0_6.exe)

**Step 2**: Run the *FreelancerHDSetup_v0_6.exe* file and install HDE.
- If you are having issues then visit the HDE wiki: https://github.com/BC46/freelancer-hd-edition/wiki
- You can also visit us on Discord to ask for help or just talk about HDE: https://discord.gg/AFBbHzU4tU
- If you are using a non-English version of the game then **DO NOT** check the *Apply English Freelancer improvements* option because it will overwrite your game with English text.

## If you are on Windows 10 or newer:
1. In the Taskbar search box type *windows features*
2. Click on *Turn Windows features on or off*
3. Find Legacy Components and click the plus icon
4. Check *DirectPlay* and click the *OK* button
5. Restart your computer.

# Installing-Mods
Once *Freelancer: HD Edition* is installed, if you haven't already and you have the space, I would actually zip up a copy of the entire folder so you can quick-install a new copy of the game at any time. To install a standalone mod just extract the zip file over HDE and you should be done if it was converted properly.

If you have questions about HDE conversions feel free to ask on the HDE Discord or on the [**Freeport 7 Discord**](https://discord.gg/ZDTZYuYX9R).
